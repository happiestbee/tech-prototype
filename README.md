# Tech Roulette Game Jam

## Introduction

This is a simple dungeon crawler game where you will proceed through rooms in order to grow stronger and defeat stronger enemies. A very basic version is completed at the time. 

## Controls
Control your character with WASD and shoot with SPACE or Left Click. You will shoot in the direction of your cursor. You have three health represented by the hearts in the top right of the screen. Colliding with an enemy will make you lose 1 health. After getting hit, you will have a short period of invinciblity where your health squares will turn into shields. Hit enemies twice in order to kill them. Powerups have a chance of spawning from each monster kill, but monsters will also get stronger the more levels you clear.
